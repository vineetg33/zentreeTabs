TODO:
*** Implement these tasks ***
- Implement reversing all grouping tabs feature -- in case they don't like the grouping tabs
- The AI feature has to be advertized as "beta"
- Replace (which AI modes the thing can use) with a toggle to enable/disable the AI feature

*** Tasks not to execute without my approval ***
- Is it possible to keep the favicon and not have it changed when "The Marvellous Suspender" suspends the tab?
