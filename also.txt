it also seems to be that the AI is working based on the title of the tabs.
for example, if it sees 5 times with the same title "professor zhang", it will group all of those together
    same thing with multiple youtube tabs, 
    multiple google search tabs (share same keyword: google),
    multiple github tabs (share same keyword: github),
    
task: understand what's going on with the AI prompting, adn try to fix it.
